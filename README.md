# OxyRuns

## Local development reference (optional)

For development, you may want a local copy of the official oXygen `wsaccess` JavaScript sample plugins (used as reference material):

```bash
mkdir -p upstream
git clone https://github.com/oxygenxml/wsaccess-javascript-sample-plugins.git \
  upstream/oxygen-wsaccess-javascript-sample-plugins
```

This folder is intentionally ignored by Git (see .gitignore) and is not required to build or use this plugin.

To update your local reference copy:

```bash
cd upstream/oxygen-wsaccess-javascript-sample-plugins
git pull
```
